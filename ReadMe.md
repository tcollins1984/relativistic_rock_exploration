## The Relativistic Rock

This is a fun little program that will allow showcase the effects of special relativity using a simple 1 kilogram rock travelling through space. This rock will also have a tiny clock on it of mass 0.


We are in an intertial frame (non-accellerating) in relation to the rock and will study how the relative velocity of the rock to us causes its properties to change within **our** frame.
